##	Functional Interface
	-The interface which contains only one abstract method is called as function interface.

	-It is introduced in JDK 1.8

	-In functional interface we have only one abstract
 				But we can also have object class methods as abstract method because Object class 
 		is parent of all classes and interfaces	so we can use hashCode() ,toString() ,
 		equals(Object o) these methods as abstract method because these are not native and final
		other methods are either native or final so we can't use that methods declaration in
		functional interface

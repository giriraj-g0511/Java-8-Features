# Java 8 Features Repository

Welcome to the **Java 8 Features Repository**! This repository serves as a guide to the key features introduced in Java 8, with notes and programs provided for a practical understanding of each concept.

## Key Features

### Lambda Expressions
- Enable functional programming.
- Provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions.

### Functional Interfaces
- Interfaces with a single abstract method (SAM).
- Examples include `Runnable`, `Callable`, and `Comparator`.

### Method References
- A shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method.
- Syntax: `ClassName::methodName`.

### Constructor References
- Used to refer to a constructor without instantiating the class explicitly.
- Syntax: `ClassName::new`.

### Stream API
- Provides a functional approach to processing collections of data.
- Supports operations like filter, map, and reduce.

### Local Date and Time API
- Introduces new classes for handling dates and times, such as `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`.

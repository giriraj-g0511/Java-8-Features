##Stream API
	- It is predefine interface present in java.util.stream.
	- Introduced in JDK1.8
	- Used to perform bulk operation on Collection like manipulation,sorting,searching,counting,
		filter,etc.

	- It has methods like filter(),sorted(),sorted(Comparator c), min(),max(), and many more.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	#)	stream() :- 
		- It is default method in collection interface.
		- It will help to convert collection to stream type of object, so we can apply stream 
			method on collection.
		- 		default Stream<T> stream();
		
		
	#)	filter() :- 
		- It is abstract method in stream interface.
		- It will take predicate as argument.
		- It will help to perform boolean filter operation on collection object.
		- 		Stream<T> filter(Predicate p);
		
	#) map() :
		- It is abstract method present inside a stream interface.
		- It will take function as argument.
		- If we want to any manipulation operation or other than boolean operation then we go 
			for map() method.
		- 		<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T, ? extends R> mapper);
		
	#)	collect(Collector collector) :- 
		- It is abstract method in stream interface.
		- It will help to store or collect the elements after the operation and convert it 
			stream to collection object.
		- 		<R, A> R collect(Collector<? super T, A, R> collector);
	
	#)	Collectors :
		- It is a predefined final class present in java.util.stream
		- It having static methods like toList(), toMap(), toSet() and many more.
		
		#) toList :	
			- It is static method present inside collectors class.
			- It will convert stream object to list and return collector interface object.
		
		
		
	#)	Collector :
		- It is predefined interface present in java.util.stream
				
		
		
	#)	forEach() :
		- It is abstract method present inside stream interface.
		- It will take consumer as argument.
		- Once we perform operation on collection object by using stream api , directly i want 
			to print element on console then we go for forEach() method.
